# MEGABONK Custom Character Loader
A BepInEx mod for Megabonk that loads custom characters - including weapons, passives, and skins - made using the process described in my other repository (https://github.com/PeterMoras/MEGABONK_CustomCharacterMaker). 

This mod can also be found (in a short while) on Thunderstore.

Also, I already know about the error 'Material 'A' with Shader 'B' doesn't have a float or range property '_RenderFace''
I'm working on fixing it as part of the 1.2 release. But it shouldn't affect anyone's ability to create or share custom characters.
