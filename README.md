# MEGABONK Custom Character Loader
A BepInEx mod for Megabonk that loads custom characters - including weapons, passives, and skins - made using the process described in my other repository (https://github.com/PeterMoras/MEGABONK_CustomCharacterMaker). 

This mod can also be found (in a short while) on Thunderstore.

Also, I already know about the error 'Material 'A' with Shader 'B' doesn't have a float or range property '_RenderFace''
It is currently on hold as I try to solve more direct material issues, such as proper skin swapping properties.
