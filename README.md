# MEGABONK Custom Character Loader
A BepInEx mod for Megabonk that loads custom characters - including weapons, passives, and skins - made using the process described in my other repository (https://github.com/PeterMoras/MEGABONK_CustomCharacterMaker). 

This mod can also be found (in a short while) on Thunderstore.

As this is the 1.0.0 release, expect more features later. Create a github issue for feature requests or if you have issues with this mod working.
